# Apply Game-Aware Plugin Activation and Ordering

## Type

Bug, Safety, Test.

## Implementation Status

Implementation and JVM regression tests are drafted. Full local Gradle
validation and manual safe-folder/runtime verification remain required before
this task is complete.

## Requirement IDs

- REQ-PLUGIN-002
- REQ-PLUGIN-003
- REQ-PLUGIN-005
- REQ-PROFILE-002

## Problem

Before this task, DML wrote one universal pair of `plugins.txt` and
`loadorder.txt` files. It did not select output behavior by game or apply the
file-timestamp ordering required by the currently selectable legacy games. A
successful text export could therefore claim an order that Fallout: New Vegas,
Fallout 3, or Oblivion would not actually load.

## Verified Current Game Matrix

`GameCatalog.supportedGameIds` currently exposes these game IDs:

| Game ID | Display name | Activation output | Load-order mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| `skyrim_le` | Skyrim Legendary Edition | `plugins.txt` contains enabled plugins; `loadorder.txt` records the complete selected order | Text-file order |
| `oblivion` | Oblivion | `plugins.txt` contains enabled plugins | Plugin-file modification timestamps |
| `fallout_3` | Fallout 3 | `plugins.txt` contains enabled plugins | Plugin-file modification timestamps |
| `fallout_nv` | Fallout: New Vegas | `plugins.txt` contains enabled plugins | Plugin-file modification timestamps |

`GamePluginRules` also contains Fallout 4 official-plugin metadata, but Fallout
4 is not selectable. TTW has no dedicated game ID. Neither is part of this task.

For the timestamp-based games, DML may retain an internal diagnostic summary of
the selected order, but it must not describe `loadorder.txt` as the mechanism
the game uses.

## Desired Behavior

- Select plugin activation output and ordering behavior from the active game ID.
- Preserve plugin enabled state independently from order.
- Keep Skyrim LE text-file behavior separate from legacy timestamp behavior.
- Apply the full selected plugin order to plugin-file modification times for
  Oblivion, Fallout 3, and Fallout: New Vegas.
- Report which mechanism was applied and how many plugin files were ordered.
- Keep all saved plugin state and generated output isolated to the active
  profile.

## Profile Isolation

The existing `ProfileStoragePaths` and `ProfileScopedEngineFactory` construction
must remain authoritative:

- `plugins.json`, `plugins.txt`, and any `loadorder.txt` output stay under the
  active profile state directory;
- switching profiles must not read or rewrite another profile's plugin state;
- timestamp application targets only the active profile's configured Data
  target or its profile-specific simulated deployment directory.

## Failure Behavior

- Unknown or unsupported game IDs fail before output files or timestamps change.
- If no saved plugin list exists, the workflow may perform its existing one-time
  plugin refresh. If the list remains empty, it fails without output changes.
- Timestamp ordering preflights the complete ordered plugin set before changing
  any file.
- Missing files, duplicate case-insensitive plugin names, an invalid Data target,
  or a read-only target fail before mutation where practical.
- Original timestamps are captured before mutation. A partial timestamp failure
  attempts to restore every changed timestamp and reports any rollback failure.
- Timestamp-based games require a valid writable direct Data-folder path and
  fail before changing activation output when that target is unavailable.
- Existing valid plugin output files are preserved when replacement fails where
  practical.

## Automated Unit Tests

Add JVM coverage for:

1. The four selectable game IDs and their declared ordering mechanisms.
2. Skyrim LE output: enabled-only `plugins.txt`, complete-order `loadorder.txt`,
   and no timestamp request.
3. Oblivion, Fallout 3, and Fallout: New Vegas output: enabled-only
   `plugins.txt` and timestamp ordering.
4. Timestamp order uses strictly increasing modification times in selected
   priority order.
5. Disabled plugins remain disabled while still retaining selected priority.
6. Missing target plugin preflight changes no timestamps.
7. Duplicate case-insensitive plugin names are rejected before mutation.
8. A mid-application failure restores already changed timestamps.
9. Workflow logs the selected game and applied mechanism.
10. Empty-list fallback and operation-in-progress behavior remain unchanged.
11. Profile storage path tests continue to prove separate profile directories.

## Manual Runtime Verification

For each selectable game profile:

1. Create or select a dedicated test profile and safe test Data directory.
2. Add at least one enabled and one disabled non-official plugin.
3. Reorder the plugins and restart DML; confirm state and priority persist.
4. Apply plugin output/order.
5. Confirm `plugins.txt` contains only enabled plugins in selected order.
6. For Skyrim LE, confirm `loadorder.txt` contains the complete selected order
   and plugin timestamps were not rewritten.
7. For Oblivion, Fallout 3, and Fallout: New Vegas, confirm plugin timestamps are
   strictly increasing in selected order and no output is presented as the
   authoritative load-order mechanism.
8. Force a missing-plugin failure and confirm existing output files and prior
   timestamps remain unchanged where practical.
9. Clear or invalidate the direct Data target and confirm DML refuses the
   operation with a clear explanation and no partial changes.
10. Switch profiles and confirm neither saved state nor outputs changed in the
    inactive profile.
11. Launch each game in the target container and confirm the enabled set and
    effective load order match DML.

## Recorded Disposable-Folder Results — 2026-06-22

- Skyrim LE produced enabled-only `plugins.txt` and complete-order
  `loadorder.txt` without relying on timestamp ordering.
- Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 3, and Oblivion produced enabled-only
  `plugins.txt` and strictly increasing timestamps in selected priority order.
- Disabled plugins remained absent from activation output while retaining their
  selected timestamp priority.
- Reordering and reapplying changed timestamp order as expected.
- Actual game/container consumption of the generated activation files and
  effective load order remains to be verified.

## Files Likely Affected

Verified current source areas:

- `app/src/main/java/com/shonkware/droidmodloader/engine/plugins/GamePluginRules.kt`
- a focused game-order rule type under `engine/plugins/`
- a reusable timestamp-ordering component under `engine/plugins/`
- `app/src/main/java/com/shonkware/droidmodloader/engine/data/PluginOutputRepository.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/shonkware/droidmodloader/engine/ModEngine.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/shonkware/droidmodloader/ui/workflow/PluginManagementWorkflow.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/shonkware/droidmodloader/MainActivity.kt`
- JVM tests under `app/src/test/java/.../engine/plugins/` and
  `app/src/test/java/.../ui/workflow/`
- plugin-related public documentation if user-visible behavior changes

## Explicit Exclusions

- A new TTW profile or game definition.
- Fallout 3 or Oblivion setup redesign.
- `DML_output` or external handoff-folder work.
- LOOT or xEdit integration.
- INI presets or configuration recipes.
- Broad `ModEngine` service extraction.
- Plugin dependency analysis, missing-master detection, or automatic sorting.
- General game-folder validation redesign.
