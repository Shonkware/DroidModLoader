# Droid Mod Loader Source Map

This document maps important source files and folders to their current responsibilities.

Use this when planning changes so work does not get shoved into the wrong file.

## Source Root

`app/src/main/java/com/shonkware/droidmodloader/`

UI rules:

- UI should display state and trigger actions.
- UI should not directly own deployment, deletion, backup, or recovery logic.
- UI should remain readable across normal phone and handheld layouts.
- Developer tools should stay hidden unless developer mode is unlocked.
- Recovery tools should stay reachable for normal users.

## Engine

| Folder                   | Responsibility                                                  |

## High-Risk Files

Changes to these areas require careful test steps:

| Area                     | Risk                                          |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Deployment plan building | Can copy, skip, update, or remove wrong files |
| Deployment execution     | Can write to the wrong target                 |
| Journal/recovery         | Can fail to recover interrupted operations    |
| Path utilities           | Can allow unsafe paths                        |
| Profile persistence      | Can leak state across profiles                |
| Plugin export            | Can produce broken load order files           |
| Resolver/conflict logic  | Can choose the wrong winning file             |

## Refactor Targets

These files/areas should be reduced over time:

| Target               | Reason                                                                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Large UI composables | Should be broken into reusable components when they become hard to read    |
| Deployment code      | Planning, preflight, journal, execution, and recovery must remain separate |

## Change Placement Rules

Use these rules when deciding where code belongs:

| Change                    | Preferred Location                                     |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|

| Mod/archive installation  | `engine/service/ModLibraryService.kt` plus `engine/install/` |
| Mod import behavior       | `engine/install/`                                      |
| File indexing             | `engine/index/`                                        |

| Deployment plan           | `engine/deploy/plan/`                                  |
| Deployment orchestration  | `engine/service/DeploymentService.kt`                   |
| Deployment execution      | `engine/deploy/`                                       |
| Recovery/journal          | `engine/deploy/journal/`                               |
| Path safety               | `engine/util/` or rules-specific helpers               |
| Release process           | `docs/release-checklist.md`                            |
| Project direction         | `docs/vision.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, or `docs/decisions.md` |

## Rule

Before modifying a large file, ask:

1. Is this the right file for the change?
2. Is this making the file harder to understand?
3. Should this be a new helper/service instead?
4. What test proves this did not break risky behavior?
