# Droid Mod Loader Roadmap

This roadmap defines the major direction and release sequence for Droid Mod Loader.

It is not the active task list and should not be used as a substitute for scoped implementation work.

## Planning Rules

- Use this roadmap for release boundaries, major phases, and long-term direction.
- Use `CURRENT_STATUS.md` for the current repository and release state.
- Use `docs/tasks/current-priorities.md` for the next 3 to 7 focused tasks.
- Use `docs/tasks/backlog.md` for rough, deferred, or unscoped ideas.
- Use GitHub Issues for implementation-ready tasks.
- Use `docs/requirements.md` for testable product requirements.
- Use `docs/decisions.md` for accepted technical and product decisions.
- Convert roadmap items into scoped tasks before implementation.
- Do not delay a release for work that is explicitly outside that release boundary.

## Product Direction

Droid Mod Loader is an Android mod manager for Bethesda games running through GameNative and similar Windows compatibility environments.

The intended experience is profile-first, conflict-transparent, and safe for touch-based use. The app should provide the useful parts of a desktop mod manager without copying a desktop interface or pretending Android can use Mod Organizer 2's virtual filesystem.

Droid Mod Loader uses:

- Android 11 or newer
- user granted all files access
- direct filesystem paths for shared game and mod storage
- indexed physical deployment
- profile specific state
- game aware plugin activation and ordering
- deployment planning, verification, diagnostics, and recovery

The core data flow is:

1. Import and isolate installed mods.
2. Index mod files.
3. Resolve enabled mods and file winners.
4. Build a deployment plan.
5. Deploy physical files to the selected target.
6. Verify the resulting state where practical.
7. Report warnings and diagnostics.
8. Recover safely from interrupted or invalid operations.

## Current Baseline

The public release and the development branch must be described separately.

### Public release: `v0.6.0-beta`

The latest public release is `v0.6.0-beta`.

It introduced the profile specific Archive Library and includes early support for:

- profile creation and switching
- managed mod folders
- archive import
- profile specific archive browsing, search, refresh, and folder switching
- ZIP, 7Z, and supported RAR archive handling
- basic BAIN and FOMOD detection
- mod enable and disable
- mod priority
- plugin scanning
- plugin enable and disable
- plugin output files
- deployment planning
- deployment journal and recovery foundations
- baseline and overwrite foundations
- diagnostics and logs
- experimental second-screen plugin display

These systems are functional foundations, not a claim of stable desktop-mod-manager parity.

### Development branch after `v0.6.0-beta`

The `main` branch contains completed post-release work that is not part of the public `v0.6.0-beta` APK:

- migration to one direct-filesystem storage backend
- Android 11 minimum-version enforcement for direct storage
- profile-specific direct paths for Game Root, `Data`, and Archive Library folders
- game-aware plugin activation and ordering
- timestamp ordering for Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 3, and Oblivion
- Skyrim Legendary Edition text-file ordering behavior
- direct-storage and disposable-folder validation
- completed `MainActivity` responsibility extraction
- completed `ModEngine` service extraction

This work becomes part of the next release only after release validation, documentation, packaging, and tagging are complete.

See `CURRENT_STATUS.md` for the current branch state and latest recorded validation.

## Stable 1.0 Boundary

`v1.0.0` is the first stable public release.

Stable 1.0 means Droid Mod Loader provides a safe, understandable, and repeatable core mod-management workflow. It does not mean complete Mod Organizer 2, Vortex, LOOT, xEdit, Nexus Mods, or scripted-installer parity.

The following areas must be reliable enough to block stable 1.0:

### Archive installation

- Supported archives install without corrupting managed state.
- Unsupported archive variants fail clearly.
- Partial extraction does not become a successful install.
- Temporary files are cleaned up safely.
- Existing installed mods are not damaged by a failed import.

### Profiles and game setup

- Profile state remains isolated.
- The selected game, Game Root, `Data` folder, and output state are clear.
- Invalid or suspicious targets are detected before deployment.
- Target changes do not silently reuse incompatible deployment state.
- Supported games apply the correct plugin activation and ordering rules.

### Deployment and recovery

- Deployment plans are based on the active profile and target.
- Deployment manifests and baselines are scoped to the correct target.
- Interrupted deployment is detected.
- Recovery actions are understandable and safe.
- Existing unmanaged files are not blindly removed.
- Full redeployment is available when required by target or state changes.

### Conflict and overwrite visibility

- The app can determine file winners from enabled mods and priority.
- Users can identify which mod wins or loses a conflict.
- Identical duplicates can be distinguished from meaningful conflicts where practical.
- Generated or changed files outside the managed mod folders are not silently treated as normal managed input.

### Plugin correctness

- Plugins can be discovered, enabled, disabled, and ordered.
- Output follows the active game's rules.
- Basic high-value warnings are available, including missing masters, duplicate names, disabled source mods, missing files, and plugin/archive mismatches where supported.
- Diagnostics describe likely fixes in normal language.

### Diagnostics and support

- Diagnostics include the active profile, game, target identity, plugin output state, unfinished deployment state, and useful archive failure details.
- A support report can be exported without exposing unrelated private files.
- Errors identify the failed operation and the safest next action.

### Usable Android workflow

- The normal path is understandable on portrait and landscape screens.
- Routine navigation is centered on Home, Mods, Plugins, and Deploy.
- Game and profile context remain visible.
- Advanced and developer tools do not dominate the normal workflow.
- Recovery remains accessible as a user safety feature.
- Accessibility labels and touch targets are adequate for the stable workflow.

### Verification and release readiness

- Risky file behavior has focused automated tests.
- Upgrade behavior from the previous public beta is tested.
- A debug build passes repository checks before release work.
- The release candidate is tested on representative Android storage and game-folder layouts.
- Release notes, user documentation, GitHub, and Nexus Mods information agree.

## Release Sequence

The remaining beta releases should narrow the gap to stable 1.0 in clear stages.

## `v0.7.0-beta` — Reliable Foundation

The purpose of `v0.7.0-beta` is to turn the current development branch into a dependable baseline for later feature work.

Primary scope:

- improve ZIP, 7Z, and RAR extraction compatibility
- provide precise errors for unsupported or malformed archives
- prevent partial extraction from being accepted as a successful install
- clean temporary extraction state safely
- preserve existing managed mods when import fails
- validate upgrade behavior from `v0.6.0-beta`
- retain the completed direct-filesystem migration
- retain game-aware plugin activation and ordering
- retain the extracted `MainActivity` and `ModEngine` architecture
- improve archive-related diagnostics and support information
- complete release documentation, packaging, and device checks

Work already completed on `main` should be validated and released, not described as unfinished feature scope.

Exit conditions:

- archive-install failure paths are covered by focused tests
- supported sample archives install successfully
- unsupported samples fail without partial managed state
- direct-path profile state survives restart and upgrade checks
- game-aware plugin-order tests remain green
- repository checks, JVM tests, and debug APK assembly pass
- public documentation accurately separates current and planned behavior

## `v0.8.0-beta` — Safe Setup, Deployment, and Recovery

The purpose of `v0.8.0-beta` is to make game setup and physical deployment trustworthy.

Primary scope:

- make **Choose a game** the normal setup entry
- make Game Folder selection the normal path
- detect and validate Game Root and `Data` where practical
- keep a separate advanced `Data` folder override
- improve beginner-safe folder and permission explanations
- add stronger validation for Skyrim Legendary Edition, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 3, and Oblivion
- add a dedicated Tale of Two Wastelands definition that reuses the Fallout: New Vegas engine family without presenting TTW as a generic FNV profile
- scope deployment manifests and baselines to profile, game, and target identity
- require full redeployment when target identity changes
- detect unfinished or stale deployment state
- improve recovery and post-deploy verification
- protect unmanaged files found in existing installations
- expose a visible, profile-aware `DML_output` handoff for the active profile
- expand deployment and target information in diagnostics and support reports

The app should not move or delete existing manual files unless the user explicitly chooses a separately designed adoption or cleanup action.

Exit conditions:

- invalid targets block dangerous deployment
- suspicious targets produce clear warnings
- target changes cannot silently reuse old deployment state
- interrupted deployment can be detected and handled
- unmanaged baseline files survive normal deployment and removal tests
- active-profile output cannot be confused with another profile
- supported game definitions pass folder and plugin-output checks

## `v0.9.0-beta` — Complete Core User Workflow

The purpose of `v0.9.0-beta` is to connect the reliable engine work to a complete daily-use workflow.

Primary scope:

- expand the resolved data graph
- track file winners and overwritten providers
- distinguish identical duplicates where practical
- provide understandable mod-level and file-level conflict details
- show clear overwrite status, including fully overwritten mods
- track generated output separately from normal installed mods
- support the common practical subset of BAIN and FOMOD installers
- preview installer results before committing files where practical
- fail safely when installer logic is unsupported
- add basic plugin intelligence required by the stable boundary
- add minimum useful local metadata, such as version and source-link editing
- provide a basic Settings surface for normal configuration
- apply the profile-first Home, Mods, Plugins, and Deploy navigation model
- improve portrait, landscape, and larger-screen behavior
- apply progressive disclosure so routine actions stay clear
- prepare the Red Carbon default visual direction without delaying core correctness for decorative polish

The installer goal is common-case support with safe failure. Complete scripted FOMOD compatibility is not required for stable 1.0.

Exit conditions:

- users can understand which mod wins a conflict and why
- normal install, enable, order, deploy, diagnose, and recover flows connect cleanly
- unsupported installer behavior cannot silently install the wrong file set
- required plugin warnings appear in the main workflow and support report
- routine tasks work in portrait and landscape layouts
- advanced tools remain available without overwhelming the main interface

## `v0.9.x-beta` — Stabilization

After the core `v0.9.0-beta` workflow is present, `v0.9.x-beta` releases should focus on stabilization rather than new feature areas.

Primary scope:

- fix regressions and data-migration problems
- improve performance on larger modlists
- harden cancellation and interruption behavior
- expand file-operation and upgrade tests
- verify representative GameNative and similar shared-storage workflows
- improve accessibility and confusing wording
- finish support-report privacy review
- update user documentation and troubleshooting
- complete release-candidate checks

New large integrations should not be added during stabilization unless they fix a stable-release blocker.

## `v1.0.0` — First Stable Release

Release `v1.0.0` when the stable boundary is met and the stabilization cycle finds no unresolved high-risk file-safety, profile-isolation, deployment, recovery, or plugin-correctness problem.

The stable release should provide:

- safe supported archive import
- isolated profiles
- validated game targets
- reliable deployment and recovery
- understandable conflict and overwrite information
- correct game-aware plugin output
- basic plugin diagnostics
- exportable support information
- a coherent Android workflow
- documented upgrade and release procedures

## Game Scope Through 1.0

Core pre-1.0 validation and plugin work should focus on:

- Skyrim Legendary Edition
- Fallout: New Vegas
- Fallout 3
- Oblivion
- Tale of Two Wastelands through its own game definition

Skyrim Special Edition, Fallout 4, and additional games remain later expansion targets unless a separate scoped decision changes their priority.

## Work That Does Not Block Stable 1.0

The following work may be researched or developed independently, but it should not delay `v1.0.0` unless it becomes necessary to fix a core workflow:

### Nexus Mods integration

Basic local source links and manual metadata may be included before 1.0.

The following are later features:

- Nexus account authentication
- direct Nexus downloads
- automatic update checks
- rich remote metadata synchronization
- collection download automation

### LOOT integration

LOOT metadata, suggested sorting, dirty-plugin metadata, and automatic order application are post-1.0 integration work.

Droid Mod Loader should first provide correct game-specific ordering and basic local diagnostics.

### xEdit integration

An embedded xEdit replacement or an in-app xEdit-like runner is not a stable-1.0 requirement.

Later work may include:

- importing structured reports
- presenting selected findings
- adding findings to support reports
- coordinating with external or companion tools

### Advanced installer parity

Stable 1.0 requires common installer workflows and safe unsupported behavior.

It does not require:

- complete scripted FOMOD parity
- arbitrary installer script execution
- support for every historical BAIN convention
- automatic decisions for ambiguous installer options

### Guides and collections

Guide mode, collection automation, shared setup manifests, and automatic missing-mod workflows are later product layers.

They depend on reliable metadata, installers, conflicts, diagnostics, and deployment first.

### Game configuration presets

INI presets, configuration recipes, and archive invalidation remain separate work.

They should be added only after the active-profile output workflow is safe and each preset has documented sources, prerequisites, and deterministic behavior.

These features are not stable-1.0 blockers.

### Storage expansion

A full storage manager and dedicated external-SD workflow are later features.

Pre-1.0 work should provide clear free-space errors, safe temporary-file cleanup, and understandable missing-storage warnings.

### Deeper GameNative helpers

Droid Mod Loader should continue to work through user-selected shared folders and generated output.

It should not depend on private GameNative internals. Container-specific automation, executable patching, launch helpers, and deeper environment inspection require separate scope and validation.

### Second-screen expansion

Second-screen support remains optional and experimental.

Possible later uses include:

- operation monitoring
- plugin monitoring
- selected-mod details
- support and tester reports
- environment information
- touch shortcuts

The normal app must remain fully usable without a second screen.

### Compatibility scoring and texture budgets

Texture-budget warnings, device profiles, GameNative compatibility scoring, and large-modlist recommendation systems are post-1.0 features.

## Existing Manual Installations

Droid Mod Loader must remain conservative around files it did not install.

The pre-1.0 requirement is to:

- detect existing target files
- protect them from blind deletion
- identify unmanaged plugins and loose files where practical
- keep later DML-managed deployment separate from protected baseline state

A full adoption wizard that moves, splits, or converts an existing manual installation into managed mods is later work and requires explicit user review.

## Architecture Direction

The completed responsibility extractions establish the expected structure for future work:

- `MainActivity` remains the Android composition root.
- Workflow controllers and supporting classes own UI coordination.
- `ModEngine` remains the stable engine facade.
- Focused services own mod library, plugin, deployment, inspection, and archive-history behavior.
- New behavior should be added to the focused owner instead of growing the composition root or engine facade back into multi-domain implementations.
- GRIT remains a separate project and is not a DML dependency.

Architecture cleanup should support product work. It should not become an open-ended release phase by itself.

## Current Priority

The immediate priority is `v0.7.0-beta` release hardening and publication:

1. complete the real-archive compatibility matrix on the versioned candidate
2. validate an in-place upgrade from the public `v0.6.0-beta` APK
3. verify direct-path profile and managed-state retention
4. build and inspect the signed release APK
5. test the exact upload artifact on Android
6. finalize checksums, notes, known issues, tag, and public uploads

The archive-install safety implementation is complete. Do not begin broad
`v0.8.0-beta` setup or deployment work until the reliable-foundation release is
published or the roadmap is deliberately revised.

## Documentation Alignment

For the release candidate:

- keep `CURRENT_STATUS.md` focused on actual repository and release state
- keep `docs/tasks/current-priorities.md` limited to remaining release work
- reconcile requirement and testing language with signature-based archive
  handling and transactional installation
- keep release notes limited to behavior present in the tested APK
- replace `Unreleased` and pending test notes only after final validation
- update the Nexus Mods page whenever the public DML version changes
